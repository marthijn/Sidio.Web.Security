# ASP.NET Core web security

# Goal of this project
The goal of this project is to provide a set of services, helper functions and middleware that can be used to secure an ASP.NET Core application.
All features are based on the [Mozilla Web Security Guidelines](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security).

__Note:__

The packages are currently in preview and is not yet ready for production use. During the preview phase,
breaking changes may be introduced. Extensive documentation is also still being worked on.

## .NET Framework support: Sidio.Web.Security
[Sidio.Web.Security](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sidio.Web.Security/) provides the core functionality. Can be used in projects targeting .NET Standard 2.0.
It is useful to use this package if .NET Framework is still in use. Otherwise, use [Sidio.Web.Security.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sidio.Web.Security.AspNetCore/).
Note that this package does not contain the middleware and services that are provided by the ASP.NET Core package. Feel free to make a contribution to this project or a fork
targeting .NET Framework.
